# Chapter 04 Programs – C++ Book

This folder contains solutions to basic C++ programs from **Chapter 04** of the book. The programs mainly focus on input/output manipulators and formatting in C++.

## Programs Included

1. **Input**

   * Simple program to take input from the user.

2. **Setw**

   * Demonstrates the use of `setw` manipulator to control field width in output.

3. **Setfill Manipulator**

   * Shows how to use `setfill` to fill unused spaces with a specific character.

4. **Setprecision**

   * Explains how to use `setprecision` to control the number of digits displayed after the decimal.

5. **Showpoint Manipulator**
