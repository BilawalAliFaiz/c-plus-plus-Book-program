# Chapter 05 Programs – C++ Book

This folder contains solutions to **Chapter 05** programs of the book. The programs mainly focus on **decision making and control statements** in C++.

## Programs Included

1. **If Statement**

   * Demonstrates the use of a simple `if` condition.

2. **If-Else Statement**

   * Program showing how to execute one block of code if a condition is true, otherwise another block.

3. **Multiple If-Else**

   * Explains multiple conditions using chained `if-else if-else` structure.

4. **Nested If Statement**

   * Demonstrates placing an `if` statement inside another `if` for complex conditions.

5. **Switch Statement**

   * Program to use `switch` for multiple choices, making code cleaner than multiple if-else.

6. **Goto Statement**

   * Example program using `goto` to jump to a specific part of the code (not recommended for structured programming, but useful for understanding).

## How to Run

1. Open any file in this folder in your C++ compiler (Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, or g++).
2. Compile the program.
3. Run the executable to check results.

## Learning Outcomes

* Learn how to use conditional statements in C++.
* Understand the difference between simple, multiple, and nested conditions.
* Use `switch` for cleaner multi-choice programs.
* Know how `goto` works (and why it should be avoided in professional coding).
